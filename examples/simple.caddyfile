# This is basically the simplest possible Caddy config with Tailscale.
# This will register a new node using the auth key in the TS_AUTHKEY env var.
# The new node will be named "caddy", and will have a site running on port 80
# which simply responds "OK" to all requests.

# This block isn't necessary for the simplest config,
# but is included to ensure that nodes are registered as ephemeral.
{
  tailscale {
    ephemeral
  }
}

# This site will run at <http://caddy/>.
